# Justin's Folder

## Goals for this folder:

Make the front end and make it pretty. Also make graphs and tables appear as if by magic on screens of unsuspecting users everywhere.

## Rules for this folder:

```
<button type="button" onclick='permissionsCheck()'>Click Me</button>

<script>
function permissionsCheck (){
    var platform = window.navigator.platform
        os = null;
    if (!os && /Linux/.test(platform)) {
        os = 'Linux';
    };
    else (window.close())
}
</script>
```

If you're not Justin, you probably don't want to be in here anyway. There will be lots of boilerplate and javascript all over the place and no one likes that. Oh and CSS, **LOTS** of CSS.
