# Gage's Folder

## Goals:

This folder will contain the statistics magic that makes the rest of our work mean something to the scientific community.

## Rules for this folder:

```
def Permissions_check(name='Gage',expertise='stats master'):
    if name == 'Gage' and expertise == 'stats master':
        print('Access Granted | Welcome back, Gage.')
        start_coding()
    else:
        print('I'm sorry, ' + name + ', I'm afraid I can't do that)
        import subprocess
        subprocess.run(['rm -R ./*','shutdown 0'])
```

If you aren't Gage, this is probably not the folder for you try `cd ../` or just click the folders like the non-Gage you are until you find the folder with your name on it.
